        <h3>Brittany Hernandez</h3>
        <p>Hey! I'm a rising junior who has always liked to play sports during my school years. But the one thing that I don't like about my school is that they don’t offer a spring season for the girls’ team while boys do.  This is only one example of life being unfair due to stereotypes and gender norms. I believe that if the guys get a spring season then we should too because equality. I know that other girls have similar issues to this and through this website I hope to make them feel better and push them to rebel.

        <h3>Kelli Wiliiams</h3>
        <p> Salve! I am entering my senior year of high school and am unsure of most things pertaining to my future. However, what I do know is that I love food, entertainment, and am a strong independent Black woman who needs no man. Through this website, I hope to let women all over the world know that they are not alone and that their everyday struggles are shared by many. But what I've learned from my very few years on this earth is that these struggles are necessary to life in order for growth. Some of these struggles may stem from things that you have no control of-your background, your looks, your gender- but this is what teaches you to love yourself and others. I believe that women have been gaining power slowly but will soon rule over the world even if there needs to be a very aggressive uprising to get there.  </p>

        <h3>Khendra Phillips</h3>
        <p>  When I was younger I wanted to have six businesses with an income of 1 million dollars from each. I would imagine a pink sky clothed by fluffy clouds. I, on the roof of my building, would overlook manhattan to see my building’s siblings. The air would smell like marshmallows over a robust fire and I would be happy. I never thought that in the future I would have to make some “minor” tweaks to my dream, if you could consider a whole career change minor. Throw in computer science and some photography and there you go: a revised dream where in the future I will be the CEO of a company that combines computer science and photography to teach young minds that their crazy ideas are closer to reality than they might seem. And this summer immersion program (SIP) project is just one of the many stops along my journey to accomplishing my dream. </p>
